- [ ] Remove space from the begginig and the end of tasks and categories (when we are adding or updating)
- [ ] Check if task name or category name is empty then do not send request.
- [ ] If there is no result we should prevent error and blur the result box
- [ ] display errors (using an array called **errors**)
