# Self Analyzer

**Self evaluator** is a free **open source** software to keep tracking our routin tasks and help to build up our health. for example me, personally preffer to do some routin tasks in a long-term period of time to make my self stronger and better.

## What is the purpose

Hard question to answer; in fact I think this project will continue for long time. it should help me. I think computers can help humans to have a better life. with statistics and data visualization and some alert we can be a better person! So why not?!

## How to use Self evaluator

Write now it is just a proto type and it's growing so it is not on production and if you wanna use it you have it install it manually on you machin or you Server.
But in the near future i guess we can Deploy it and make it public so that every body can benefit from it.
